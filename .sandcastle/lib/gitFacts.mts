// Git facts about Sandcastle branches: saved vs. done, shipped vs. stale.
//
// Every git read or write the orchestrator makes about an issue or batch
// branch's *progress* goes through here, so a WIP save, a Done marker and a
// stale check are each defined once and asked about consistently. main.mts
// still owns `gh` reads and the sandbox/agent lifecycle; this module knows
// nothing about either.
//
// "Saved" and "done" are deliberately different questions. A commit means only
// that an agent's work survived an interruption — see saveWorktree. "Done"
// means the orchestrator itself decided the issue is finished and recorded
// that with a Done marker — see markDone. Only markers decide what gets
// merged, picked up or closed.
